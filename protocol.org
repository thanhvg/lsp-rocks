This document describes the 3.17.x version of the language server protocol. An implementation for node of the 3.17.x version of the protocol can be found [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node][here]].

*Note:* edits to this specification can be made via a pull request against this markdown [[https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/gh-pages/_specifications/lsp/3.17/specification.md][document]].

** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew][What’s new in 3.17]]

All new 3.17 features are tagged with a corresponding since version 3.17 text or in JSDoc using =@since 3.17.0=  annotation. Major new feature are: type hierarchy, inline values, inlay hints, notebook document support and a meta model that describes the 3.17 LSP version.

A detailed list of the changes can be found in the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#version_3_17_0][change log]]

The version of the specification is used to group features into a new specification release and to refer to their first appearance. Features in the spec are kept compatible using so called capability flags which are exchanged between the client and the server during initialization.

** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#baseProtocol][Base Protocol]]

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to HTTP). The header and content part are separated by a ‘\\r\\n’.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#headerPart][Header Part]]

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a name and a value, separated by ‘: ‘ (a colon and a space). The structure of header fields conform to the [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2][HTTP semantic]]. Each header field is terminated by ‘\\r\\n’. Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each terminated with ‘\\r\\n’, and that at least one header is mandatory, this means that two ‘\\r\\n’ sequences always immediately precede the content part of a message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

| Header Field Name | Value Type | Description                                                                              |
|-------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content-Length    | number     | The length of the content part in bytes. This header is required.                        |
| Content-Type      | string     | The mime type of the content part. Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8 |

The header part is encoded using the ‘ascii’ encoding. This includes the ‘\\r\\n’ separating the header and content part.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#contentPart][Content Part]]

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [[http://www.jsonrpc.org/][JSON-RPC]] to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to =utf-8=, which is the only encoding supported right now. If a server or client receives a header with a different encoding than =utf-8=  it should respond with an error.

(Prior versions of the protocol used the string constant =utf8= which is not a correct encoding constant according to [[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml][specification]].) For backwards compatibility it is highly recommended that a client and a server treats the string =utf8= as =utf-8= .

*** Example:

#+begin_src c
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "textDocument/completion",
	"params": {
		...
	}
}

#+end_src

*** Base Protocol JSON structures

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base [[http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification][JSON-RPC protocol]]:

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#baseTypes][Base Types]]

The protocol use the following definitions for integers, unsigned integers, decimal numbers, objects and arrays:

#+begin_src c
/**
 * Defines an integer number in the range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type integer = number;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * Defines an unsigned integer number in the range of 0 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type uinteger = number;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * Defines a decimal number. Since decimal numbers are very
 * rare in the language server specification we denote the
 * exact range with every decimal using the mathematics
 * interval notation (e.g. [0, 1] denotes all decimals d with
 * 0 <= d <= 1.
 */
export type decimal = number;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * The LSP any type
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPAny = LSPObject | LSPArray | string | integer | uinteger |
	decimal | boolean | null;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * LSP object definition.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPObject = { [key: string]: LSPAny };

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * LSP arrays.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPArray = LSPAny[];

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#abstractMessage][Abstract Message]]

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol always uses “2.0” as the =jsonrpc=  version.

#+begin_src c
interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#requestMessage][Request Message]]

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server. Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the request.

#+begin_src c
interface RequestMessage extends Message {

	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string;

	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#responseMessage][Response Message]]

A Response Message sent as a result of a request. If a request doesn’t provide a result value the receiver of a request still needs to return a response message to conform to the JSON-RPC specification. The result property of the ResponseMessage should be set to =null=  in this case to signal a successful request.

#+begin_src c
interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string | null;

	/**
	 * The result of a request. This member is REQUIRED on success.
	 * This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
	 */
	result?: LSPAny;

	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError;
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
interface ResponseError {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: integer;

	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notificationMessage][Notification Message]]

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a response back. They work like events.

#+begin_src c
interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#dollarRequests][$ Notifications and Requests]]

Notification and requests whose methods start with ‘$/’ are messages which are protocol implementation dependent and might not be implementable in all clients or servers. For example if the server implementation uses a single threaded synchronous programming language then there is little a server can do to react to a =$/cancelRequest= notification. If a server or client receives notifications starting with ‘$/’ it is free to ignore the notification. If a server or client receives a request starting with ‘$/’ it must error the request with error code =MethodNotFound= (e.g. =-32601= ).

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#cancelRequest][Cancellation Support (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/27a1.png)) ((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b05.png)))]]

The base protocol offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a notification message with the following properties is sent:

/Notification/ :

- method: ‘$/cancelRequest’
- params: =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#cancelRequest][CancelParams]]=  defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: integer | string;
}

#+end_src

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the JSON-RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel. If the request returns an error response on cancellation it is advised to set the error code to =ErrorCodes.RequestCancelled= .

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#progress][Progress Support (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/27a1.png)) ((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b05.png)))]]

#+begin_quote


/Since version 3.15.0/


#+end_quote

The base protocol offers also support to report progress in a generic fashion. This mechanism can be used to report any kind of progress including [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgress][work done progress]] (usually used to report progress in the user interface using a progress bar) and partial result progress to support streaming of results.

A progress notification has the following properties:

/Notification/ :

- method: ‘$/progress’
- params: =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#progress][ProgressParams]]=  defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
type ProgressToken = integer | string;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
interface ProgressParams<T> {
	/**
	 * The progress token provided by the client or server.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;

	/**
	 * The progress data.
	 */
	value: T;
}

#+end_src

Progress is reported against a token. The token is different than the request ID which allows to report progress out of band and also for notification.

** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#languageServerProtocol][Language Server Protocol]]

The language server protocol defines a set of JSON-RPC request, response and notification messages which are exchanged using the above base protocol. This section starts describing the basic JSON structures used in the protocol. The document uses TypeScript interfaces in strict mode to describe these. This means for example that a =null=  value has to be explicitly listed and that a mandatory property must be listed even if a falsify value might exist. Based on the basic JSON structures, the actual requests with their responses and the notifications are described.

An example would be a request send from the client to the server to request a hover value for a symbol at a certain position in a text document. The request’s method would be =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_hover][textDocument/hover]]=  with a parameter like this:

#+begin_src c
interface HoverParams {
	textDocument: string; /** The text document's URI in string form */
	position: { line: uinteger; character: uinteger; };
}

#+end_src

The result of the request would be the hover to be presented. In its simple form it can be a string. So the result looks like this:

#+begin_src c
interface HoverResult {
	value: string;
}

#+end_src

Please also note that a response return value of =null=  indicates no result. It doesn’t tell the client to resend the request.

In general, the language server protocol supports JSON-RPC messages, however the base protocol defined here uses a convention such that the parameters passed to request/notification messages should be of =object= type (if passed at all). However, this does not disallow using =Array=  parameter types in custom messages.

The protocol currently assumes that one server serves one tool. There is currently no support in the protocol to share one server between different tools. Such a sharing would require additional protocol e.g. to lock a document to support concurrent editing.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#capabilities][Capabilities]]

Not every language server can support all features defined by the protocol. LSP therefore provides ‘capabilities’. A capability groups a set of language features. A development tool and the language server announce their supported features using capabilities. As an example, a server announces that it can handle the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_hover][textDocument/hover]]= request, but it might not handle the =workspace/symbol= request. Similarly, a development tool announces its ability to provide =about to save=  notifications before a document is saved, so that a server can compute textual edits to format the edited document before it is saved.

The set of capabilities is exchanged between the client and server during the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initialize][initialize]] request.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#messageOrdering][Request, Notification and Response Ordering]]

Responses to requests should be sent in roughly the same order as the requests appear on the server or client side. So for example if a server receives a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][textDocument/completion]]= request and then a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_signatureHelp][textDocument/signatureHelp]]= request it will usually first return the response for the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][textDocument/completion]]= and then the response for =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_signatureHelp][textDocument/signatureHelp]]= .

However, the server may decide to use a parallel execution strategy and may wish to return responses in a different order than the requests were received. The server may do so as long as this reordering doesn’t affect the correctness of the responses. For example, reordering the result of =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][textDocument/completion]]= and =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_signatureHelp][textDocument/signatureHelp]]= is allowed, as each of these requests usually won’t affect the output of the other. On the other hand, the server most likely should not reorder =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_definition][textDocument/definition]]= and =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_rename][textDocument/rename]]=  requests, since executing the latter may affect the result of the former.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#messageDocumentation][Message Documentation]]

As said LSP defines a set of requests, responses and notifications. Each of those are documented using the following format:

- a header describing the request
- an optional /Client capability/  section describing the client capability of the request. This includes the client capabilities property path and JSON structure.
- an optional /Server Capability/  section describing the server capability of the request. This includes the server capabilities property path and JSON structure. Clients should ignore server capabilities they don’t understand (e.g. the initialize request shouldn’t fail in this case).
- an optional /Registration Options/ section describing the registration option if the request or notification supports dynamic capability registration. See the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#client_registerCapability][register]] and [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#client_unregisterCapability][unregister]] request for how this works in detail.
- a /Request/  section describing the format of the request sent. The method is a string identifying the request, the params are documented using a TypeScript interface. It is also documented whether the request supports work done progress and partial result progress.
- a /Response/  section describing the format of the response. The result item describes the returned data in case of a success. The optional partial result item describes the returned data of a partial result notification. The error.data describes the returned data in case of an error. Please remember that in case of a failure the response already contains an error.code and an error.message field. These fields are only specified if the protocol forces the use of certain error codes or messages. In cases where the server can decide on these values freely they aren’t listed here.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#basicJsonStructures][Basic JSON Structures]]

There are quite some JSON structures that are shared between different requests and notifications. Their structure and capabilities are documented in this section.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#uri][URI]]

URI’s are transferred as strings. The URI’s format is defined in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986][https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986]]

#+begin_src c
  foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
  \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
   |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
   |   _____________________|__
  / \ /                        \
  urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

#+end_src

We also maintain a node module to parse a string into =scheme=, =authority=, =path=, =query=, and =fragment= URI components. The GitHub repository is [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri][https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri]], and the npm module is [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri][https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri]].

Many of the interfaces contain fields that correspond to the URI of a document. For clarity, the type of such a field is declared as a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#documentUri][DocumentUri]]= . Over the wire, it will still be transferred as a string, but this guarantees that the contents of that string can be parsed as a valid URI.

Care should be taken to handle encoding in URIs. For example, some clients (such as VS Code) may encode colons in drive letters while others do not. The URIs below are both valid, but clients and servers should be consistent with the form they use themselves to ensure the other party doesn’t interpret them as distinct URIs. Clients and servers should not assume that each other are encoding the same way (for example a client encoding colons in drive letters cannot assume server responses will have encoded colons). The same applies to casing of drive letters - one party should not assume the other party will return paths with drive letters cased the same as itself.

#+begin_src c
file:///c:/project/readme.md
file:///C%3A/project/readme.md

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
type DocumentUri = string;

#+end_src

There is also a tagging interface for normal non document URIs. It maps to a =string=  as well.

#+begin_src c
type URI = string;

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#regExp][Regular Expressions]]

Regular expression are a powerful tool and there are actual use cases for them in the language server protocol. However the downside with them is that almost every programming language has its own set of regular expression features so the specification can not simply refer to them as a regular expression. So the LSP uses a two step approach to support regular expressions:

- the client will announce which regular expression engine it will use. This will allow server that are written for a very specific client make full use of the regular expression capabilities of the client
- the specification will define a set of regular expression features that should be supported by a client. Instead of writing a new specification LSP will refer to the [[https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects][ECMAScript Regular Expression specification]] and remove features from it that are not necessary in the context of LSP or hard to implement for other clients.

/Client Capability/ :

The following client capability is used to announce a client’s regular expression engine

- property path (optional): =general.regularExpressions= 
- property type: =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#regExp][RegularExpressionsClientCapabilities]]=  defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
/**
 * Client capabilities specific to regular expressions.
 */
export interface RegularExpressionsClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * The engine's name.
	 */
	engine: string;

	/**
	 * The engine's version.
	 */
	version?: string;
}

#+end_src

The following table lists the well known engine values. Please note that the table should be driven by the community which integrates LSP into existing clients. It is not the goal of the spec to list all available regular expression engines.

| Engine     | Version  | Documentation                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ECMAScript | ~ES2020~ | [[https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects][ECMAScript 2020]] & [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions][MDN]] |

/Regular Expression Subset/ :

The following features from the [[https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects][ECMAScript 2020]] regular expression specification are NOT mandatory for a client:

- /Assertions/ : Lookahead assertion, Negative lookahead assertion, lookbehind assertion, negative lookbehind assertion.
- /Character classes/: matching control characters using caret notation (e.g. =\cX=) and matching UTF-16 code units (e.g. =\uhhhh= ).
- /Group and ranges/ : named capturing groups.
- /Unicode property escapes/ : none of the features needs to be supported.

The only regular expression flag that a client needs to support is ‘i’ to specify a case insensitive search.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#enumerations][Enumerations]]

The protocol supports two kind of enumerations: (a) integer based enumerations and (b) string based enumerations. Integer based enumerations usually start with =1=. The ones that don’t are historical and they were kept to stay backwards compatible. If appropriate, the value set of an enumeration is announced by the defining side (e.g. client or server) and transmitted to the other side during the initialize handshake. An example is the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionItemKind][CompletionItemKind]]= enumeration. It is announced by the client using the =textDocument.completion.completionItemKind=  client property.

To support the evolution of enumerations the using side of an enumeration shouldn’t fail on an enumeration value it doesn’t know. It should simply ignore it as a value it can use and try to do its best to preserve the value on round trips. Lets look at the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionItemKind][CompletionItemKind]]= enumeration as an example again: if in a future version of the specification an additional completion item kind with the value =n=  gets added and announced by a client an (older) server not knowing about the value should not fail but simply ignore the value as a usable item kind.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocuments][Text Documents]]

The current protocol is tailored for textual documents whose content can be represented as a string. There is currently no support for binary documents. A position inside a document (see Position definition below) is expressed as a zero-based line and character offset.

#+begin_quote


New in 3.17


#+end_quote

Prior to 3.17 the offsets were always based on a UTF-16 string representation. So in a string of the form =a𐐀b= the character offset of the character =a= is 0, the character offset of =𐐀= is 1 and the character offset of b is 3 since =𐐀= is represented using two code units in UTF-16. Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it’s supported encoding via the client capability [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#clientCapabilities][=general.positionEncodings=]]. The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index =0= is the most preferred one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16 represented via the string =utf-16=. The server can pick one of the encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the client via the initialize result’s property [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#serverCapabilities][=capabilities.positionEncoding=]]. If the string value =utf-16= is missing from the client’s capability =general.positionEncodings= servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults to the string value =utf-16= . Implementation considerations: since the conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is usually on the server side.

To ensure that both client and server split the string into the same line representation the protocol specifies the following end-of-line sequences: ‘\\n’, ‘\\r\\n’ and ‘\\r’. Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position that denotes =\r|\n= or =\n|= where =|=  represents the character offset.

#+begin_src c
export const EOL: string[] = ['\n', '\r\n', '\r'];

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#position][Position]]

Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and zero-based character offset. A position is between two characters like an ‘insert’ cursor in an editor. Special values like for example =-1=  to denote the end of a line are not supported.

#+begin_src c
interface Position {
	/**
	 * Line position in a document (zero-based).
	 */
	line: uinteger;

	/**
	 * Character offset on a line in a document (zero-based). The meaning of this
	 * offset is determined by the negotiated `PositionEncodingKind`.
	 *
	 * If the character value is greater than the line length it defaults back
	 * to the line length.
	 */
	character: uinteger;
}

#+end_src

When describing positions the protocol needs to specify how offsets (specifically character offsets) should be interpreted. The corresponding =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#positionEncodingKind][PositionEncodingKind]]=  is negotiated between the client and the server during initialization.

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A type indicating how positions are encoded,
 * specifically what column offsets mean.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type PositionEncodingKind = string;

/**
 * A set of predefined position encoding kinds.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export namespace PositionEncodingKind {

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-8 code units (e.g bytes).
	 */
	export const UTF8: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-8';

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-16 code units.
	 *
	 * This is the default and must always be supported
	 * by servers
	 */
	export const UTF16: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-16';

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-32 code units.
	 *
	 * Implementation note: these are the same as Unicode code points,
	 * so this `PositionEncodingKind` may also be used for an
	 * encoding-agnostic representation of character offsets.
	 */
	export const UTF32: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-32';
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#range][Range]]

A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions. A range is comparable to a selection in an editor. Therefore, the end position is exclusive. If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line. For example:

#+begin_src c
{
    start: { line: 5, character: 23 },
    end : { line: 6, character: 0 }
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
interface Range {
	/**
	 * The range's start position.
	 */
	start: Position;

	/**
	 * The range's end position.
	 */
	end: Position;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentItem][TextDocumentItem]]

An item to transfer a text document from the client to the server.

#+begin_src c
interface TextDocumentItem {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The text document's language identifier.
	 */
	languageId: string;

	/**
	 * The version number of this document (it will increase after each
	 * change, including undo/redo).
	 */
	version: integer;

	/**
	 * The content of the opened text document.
	 */
	text: string;
}

#+end_src

Text documents have a language identifier to identify a document on the server side when it handles more than one language to avoid re-interpreting the file extension. If a document refers to one of the programming languages listed below it is recommended that clients use those ids.

| Language            | Identifier                                                      |

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentIdentifier][TextDocumentIdentifier]]

Text documents are identified using a URI. On the protocol level, URIs are passed as strings. The corresponding JSON structure looks like this:

#+begin_src c
interface TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#versionedTextDocumentIdentifier][VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier]]

An identifier to denote a specific version of a text document. This information usually flows from the client to the server.

#+begin_src c
interface VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier extends TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The version number of this document.
	 *
	 * The version number of a document will increase after each change,
	 * including undo/redo. The number doesn't need to be consecutive.
	 */
	version: integer;
}

#+end_src

An identifier which optionally denotes a specific version of a text document. This information usually flows from the server to the client.

#+begin_src c
interface OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier extends TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The version number of this document. If an optional versioned text document
	 * identifier is sent from the server to the client and the file is not
	 * open in the editor (the server has not received an open notification
	 * before) the server can send `null` to indicate that the version is
	 * known and the content on disk is the master (as specified with document
	 * content ownership).
	 *
	 * The version number of a document will increase after each change,
	 * including undo/redo. The number doesn't need to be consecutive.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentPositionParams][TextDocumentPositionParams]]

Was =TextDocumentPosition=  in 1.0 with inlined parameters.

A parameter literal used in requests to pass a text document and a position inside that document. It is up to the client to decide how a selection is converted into a position when issuing a request for a text document. The client can for example honor or ignore the selection direction to make LSP request consistent with features implemented internally.

#+begin_src c
interface TextDocumentPositionParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	 * The position inside the text document.
	 */
	position: Position;
}

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#documentFilter][DocumentFilter]]

A document filter denotes a document through properties like =language=, =scheme= or =pattern=. An example is a filter that applies to TypeScript files on disk. Another example is a filter that applies to JSON files with name =package.json= :

#+begin_src c
{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }
{ language: 'json', pattern: '**/package.json' }

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
export interface DocumentFilter {
	/**
	 * A language id, like `typescript`.
	 */
	language?: string;

	/**
	 * A Uri scheme, like `file` or `untitled`.
	 */
	scheme?: string;

	/**
	 * A glob pattern, like `*.{ts,js}`.
	 *
	 * Glob patterns can have the following syntax:
	 * - `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment
	 * - `?` to match on one character in a path segment
	 * - `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
	 * - `{}` to group sub patterns into an OR expression. (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}`
	 *   matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)
	 * - `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment
	 *   (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)
	 * - `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment
	 *   (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but
	 *   not `example.0`)
	 */
	pattern?: string;
}

#+end_src

Please note that for a document filter to be valid at least one of the properties for =language=, =scheme=, or =pattern=  must be set. To keep the type definition simple all properties are marked as optional.

A document selector is the combination of one or more document filters.

#+begin_src c
export type DocumentSelector = DocumentFilter[];

#+begin_quote


New in version 3.16: Support for =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#annotatedTextEdit][AnnotatedTextEdit]]= .


#+end_quote

A textual edit applicable to a text document.

#+begin_src c
interface TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The range of the text document to be manipulated. To insert
	 * text into a document create a range where start === end.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The string to be inserted. For delete operations use an
	 * empty string.
	 */
	newText: string;
}

#+end_src

Since 3.16.0 there is also the concept of an annotated text edit which supports to add an annotation to a text edit. The annotation can add information describing the change to the text edit.

#+begin_src c
/**
 * Additional information that describes document changes.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface ChangeAnnotation {
	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the actual change. The string
	 * is rendered prominent in the user interface.
	 */
	label: string;

	/**
	 * A flag which indicates that user confirmation is needed
	 * before applying the change.
	 */
	needsConfirmation?: boolean;

	/**
	 * A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent in
	 * the user interface.
	 */
	description?: string;
}

#+end_src

Usually clients provide options to group the changes along the annotations they are associated with. To support this in the protocol an edit or resource operation refers to a change annotation using an identifier and not the change annotation literal directly. This allows servers to use the identical annotation across multiple edits or resource operations which then allows clients to group the operations under that change annotation. The actual change annotations together with their identifiers are managed by the workspace edit via the new property =changeAnnotations= .

#+begin_src c
/**
 * An identifier referring to a change annotation managed by a workspace
 * edit.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.
 */
export type ChangeAnnotationIdentifier = string;

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A special text edit with an additional change annotation.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0.

export interface AnnotatedTextEdit extends TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The actual annotation identifier.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textEditArray][TextEdit()]]

Complex text manipulations are described with an array of =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textEdit][TextEdit]]=’s or =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#annotatedTextEdit][AnnotatedTextEdit]]= ’s, representing a single change to the document.

All text edits ranges refer to positions in the document they are computed on. They therefore move a document from state S1 to S2 without describing any intermediate state. Text edits ranges must never overlap, that means no part of the original document must be manipulated by more than one edit. However, it is possible that multiple edits have the same start position: multiple inserts, or any number of inserts followed by a single remove or replace edit. If multiple inserts have the same position, the order in the array defines the order in which the inserted strings appear in the resulting text.

The text document is referred to as a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#optionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier][OptionalVersionedTextDocumentIdentifier]]= to allow clients to check the text document version before an edit is applied. A =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentEdit][TextDocumentEdit]]= describes all changes on a version Si and after they are applied move the document to version Si+1. So the creator of a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentEdit][TextDocumentEdit]]=  doesn’t need to sort the array of edits or do any kind of ordering.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspaceEdit][WorkspaceEdit]]

A workspace edit represents changes to many resources managed in the workspace. The edit should either provide =changes= or =documentChanges=. If the client can handle versioned document edits and if =documentChanges= are present, the latter are preferred over =changes= .

Since version 3.13.0 a workspace edit can contain resource operations (create, delete or rename files and folders) as well. If resource operations are present clients need to execute the operations in the order in which they are provided. So a workspace edit for example can consist of the following two changes: (1) create file a.txt and (2) a text document edit which insert text into file a.txt. An invalid sequence (e.g. (1) delete file a.txt and (2) insert text into file a.txt) will cause failure of the operation. How the client recovers from the failure is described by the client capability: =workspace.workspaceEdit.failureHandling=

#+begin_src c

	/**
	 * Holds changes to existing resources.
	 */
	changes?: { [uri: DocumentUri]: TextEdit[]; };

***** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initiatingWorkDoneProgress][Initiating Work Done Progress]]

Work Done progress can be initiated in two different ways:

1. by the sender of a request (mostly clients) using the predefined =workDoneToken=  property in the requests parameter literal. The document will refer to this kind of progress as client initiated progress.
2. by a server using the request =window/workDoneProgress/create= . The document will refer to this kind of progress as server initiated progress.

****** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#clientInitiatedProgress][Client Initiated Progress]]

Consider a client sending a =textDocument/reference= request to a server and the client accepts work done progress reporting on that request. To signal this to the server the client would add a =workDoneToken=  property to the reference request parameters. Something like this:

#+begin_src c
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae"
}

#+end_src

The corresponding type definition for the parameter property looks like this:

#+begin_src c
export interface WorkDoneProgressParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report work done progress.
	 */
	workDoneToken?: ProgressToken;
}

#+end_src

A server uses the =workDoneToken= to report progress for the specific =textDocument/reference=. For the above request the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]=  notification params look like this:

#+begin_src c
{
	"token": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	"value": {
		"kind": "begin",
		"title": "Finding references for A#foo",
		"cancellable": false,
		"message": "Processing file X.ts",
		"percentage": 0
	}
}

#+end_src

The token received via the =workDoneToken=  property in a request’s param literal is only valid as long as the request has not send a response back. Canceling work done progress is done by simply canceling the corresponding request.

There is no specific client capability signaling whether a client will send a progress token per request. The reason for this is that this is in many clients not a static aspect and might even change for every request instance for the same request type. So the capability is signal on every request instance by the presence of a =workDoneToken=  property.

To avoid that clients set up a progress monitor user interface before sending a request but the server doesn’t actually report any progress a server needs to signal general work done progress reporting support in the corresponding server capability. For the above find references example a server would signal such a support by setting the =referencesProvider=  property in the server capabilities as follows:

#+begin_src c
{
	"referencesProvider": {
		"workDoneProgress": true
	}
}

#+end_src

The corresponding type definition for the server capability looks like this:

#+begin_src c
export interface WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	workDoneProgress?: boolean;
}

#+end_src

****** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#serverInitiatedProgress][Server Initiated Progress]]

Servers can also initiate progress reporting using the =window/workDoneProgress/create=  request. This is useful if the server needs to report progress outside of a request (for example the server needs to re-index a database). The token can then be used to report progress using the same notifications used as for client initiated progress. The token provided in the create request should only be used once (e.g. only one begin, many report and one end notification should be sent to it).

To keep the protocol backwards compatible servers are only allowed to use =window/workDoneProgress/create= request if the client signals corresponding support using the client capability =window.workDoneProgress=  which is defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
	/**
	 * Window specific client capabilities.
	 */
	window?: {
		/**
		 * Whether client supports server initiated progress using the
		 * `window/workDoneProgress/create` request.
		 */
		workDoneProgress?: boolean;
	};

#+end_src

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#partialResults][Partial Result Progress]]

#+begin_quote


/Since version 3.15.0/


#+end_quote

Partial results are also reported using the generic  =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]= notification. The value payload of a partial result progress notification is in most cases the same as the final result. For example the =workspace/symbol= request has =SymbolInformation[]= | =WorkspaceSymbol[]= as the result type. Partial result is therefore also of type =SymbolInformation[]= | =WorkspaceSymbol[]=. Whether a client accepts partial result notifications for a request is signaled by adding a =partialResultToken= to the request parameter. For example, a =textDocument/reference=  request that supports both work done and partial result progress might look like this:

#+begin_src c
{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	// The token used to report partial result progress.
	"partialResultToken": "5f6f349e-4f81-4a3b-afff-ee04bff96804"
}

#+end_src

The =partialResultToken=  is then used to report partial results for the find references request.

If a server reports partial result via a corresponding =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]=, the whole result must be reported using n =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]= notifications. Each of the n =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]=  notification appends items to the result. The final response has to be empty in terms of result values. This avoids confusion about how the final result should be interpreted, e.g. as another partial result or as a replacing result.

If the response errors the provided partial results should be treated as follows:

- the =code= equals to =RequestCancelled= : the client is free to use the provided results but should make clear that the request got canceled and may be incomplete.
- in all other cases the provided partial results shouldn’t be used.

The current protocol specification defines that the lifecycle of a server is managed by the client (e.g. a tool like VS Code or Emacs). It is up to the client to decide when to start (process-wise) and when to shutdown a server.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initialize][Initialize Request (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/21a9.png)))]]

The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives a request or notification before the =initialize=  request it should act as follows:

- For a request the response should be an error with =code: -32002= . The message can be picked by the server.
- Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.

Until the server has responded to the =initialize= request with an =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initializeResult][InitializeResult]]=, the client must not send any additional requests or notifications to the server. In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client until it has responded with an =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initializeResult][InitializeResult]]=, with the exception that during the =initialize= request the server is allowed to send the notifications =window/showMessage=, =window/logMessage= and =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#telemetry_event][telemetry/event]]= as well as the =window/showMessageRequest= request to the client. In case the client sets up a progress token in the initialize params (e.g. property =workDoneToken=) the server is also allowed to use that token (and only that token) using the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workDoneProgressBegin][$/progress]]=  notification sent from the server to the client.

The =initialize=  request may only be sent once.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#client_registerCapability][Register Capability (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/21aa.png)))]]

The =client/registerCapability= request is sent from the server to the client to register for a new capability on the client side. Not all clients need to support dynamic capability registration. A client opts in via the =dynamicRegistration= property on the specific client capabilities. A client can even provide dynamic registration for capability A but not for capability B (see =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentClientCapabilities][TextDocumentClientCapabilities]]=  as an example).

Server must not register the same capability both statically through the initialize result and dynamically for the same document selector. If a server wants to support both static and dynamic registration it needs to check the client capability in the initialize request and only register the capability statically if the client doesn’t support dynamic registration for that capability.

/Request/ :

- method: ‘client/registerCapability’
- params: =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#registrationParams][RegistrationParams]]= 

Where =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#registrationParams][RegistrationParams]]=  are defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
/**

 */
export interface Registration {
	/**

	 * the request again.

	 */
	registerOptions?: LSPAny;
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
export interface RegistrationParams {
	registrations: Registration[];
}

#+end_src

Since most of the registration options require to specify a document selector there is a base interface that can be used. See =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentRegistrationOptions][TextDocumentRegistrationOptions]]= .

An example JSON-RPC message to register dynamically for the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_willSaveWaitUntil][textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil]]=  feature on the client side is as follows (only details shown):

The shutdown request is sent from the client to the server. It asks the server to shut down, but to not exit (otherwise the response might not be delivered correctly to the client). There is a separate exit notification that asks the server to exit. Clients must not send any notifications other than =exit= or requests to a server to which they have sent a shutdown request. Clients should also wait with sending the =exit= notification until they have received a response from the =shutdown=  request.

If a server receives requests after a shutdown request those requests should error with =InvalidRequest= .

The document open notification is sent from the client to the server to signal newly opened text documents. The document’s content is now managed by the client and the server must not try to read the document’s content using the document’s Uri. Open in this sense means it is managed by the client. It doesn’t necessarily mean that its content is presented in an editor. An open notification must not be sent more than once without a corresponding close notification send before. This means open and close notification must be balanced and the max open count for a particular textDocument is one. Note that a server’s ability to fulfill requests is independent of whether a text document is open or closed.

The =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#didOpenTextDocumentParams][DidOpenTextDocumentParams]]= contain the language id the document is associated with. If the language id of a document changes, the client needs to send a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didClose][textDocument/didClose]]= to the server followed by a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didOpen][textDocument/didOpen]]=  with the new language id if the server handles the new language id as well.

*** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notebookDocument_synchronization][Notebook Document Synchronization]]

Notebooks are becoming more and more popular. Adding support for them to the language server protocol allows notebook editors to reuse language smarts provided by the server inside a notebook or a notebook cell, respectively. To reuse protocol parts and therefore server implementations notebooks are modeled in the following way in LSP:

- /notebook document/ : a collection of notebook cells typically stored in a file on disk. A notebook document has a type and can be uniquely identified using a resource URI.
- /notebook cell/ : holds the actual text content. Cells have a kind (either code or markdown). The actual text content of the cell is stored in a text document which can be synced to the server like all other text documents. Cell text documents have an URI however servers should not rely on any format for this URI since it is up to the client on how it will create these URIs. The URIs must be unique across ALL notebook cells and can therefore be used to uniquely identify a notebook cell or the cell’s text document.

The two concepts are defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A notebook document.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface NotebookDocument {

	/**
	 * The notebook document's URI.
	 */
	uri: URI;

	/**
	 * The type of the notebook.
	 */
	notebookType: string;

	/**
	 * The version number of this document (it will increase after each
	 * change, including undo/redo).
	 */
	version: integer;

	/**
	 * Additional metadata stored with the notebook
	 * document.
	 */
	metadata?: LSPObject;

	/**
	 * The cells of a notebook.
	 */
	cells: NotebookCell[];
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A notebook cell.
 *
 * A cell's document URI must be unique across ALL notebook
 * cells and can therefore be used to uniquely identify a
 * notebook cell or the cell's text document.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface NotebookCell {

	/**
	 * The cell's kind
	 */
	kind: NotebookCellKind;

	/**
	 * The URI of the cell's text document
	 * content.
	 */
	document: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * Additional metadata stored with the cell.
	 */
	metadata?: LSPObject;

	/**
	 * Additional execution summary information
	 * if supported by the client.
	 */
	executionSummary?: ExecutionSummary;
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A notebook cell kind.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export namespace NotebookCellKind {

	/**
	 * A markup-cell is formatted source that is used for display.
	 */
	export const Markup: 1 = 1;

	/**
	 * A code-cell is source code.
	 */
	export const Code: 2 = 2;
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
export interface ExecutionSummary {
	/**
	 * A strict monotonically increasing value
	 * indicating the execution order of a cell
	 * inside a notebook.
	 */
	executionOrder: uinteger;

	/**
	 * Whether the execution was successful or
	 * not if known by the client.
	 */
	success?: boolean;
}

#+end_src

Next we describe how notebooks, notebook cells and the content of a notebook cell should be synchronized to a language server.

Syncing the text content of a cell is relatively easy since clients should model them as text documents. However since the URI of a notebook cell’s text document should be opaque, servers can not know its scheme nor its path. However what is know is the notebook document itself. We therefore introduce a special filter for notebook cell documents:

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A notebook cell text document filter denotes a cell text
 * document by different properties.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface NotebookCellTextDocumentFilter {
	/**
	 * A filter that matches against the notebook
	 * containing the notebook cell. If a string
	 * value is provided it matches against the
	 * notebook type. '*' matches every notebook.
	 */
	notebook: string | NotebookDocumentFilter;

	/**
	 * A language id like `python`.
	 *
	 * Will be matched against the language id of the
	 * notebook cell document. '*' matches every language.
	 */
	language?: string;
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
/**
 * A notebook document filter denotes a notebook document by
 * different properties.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type NotebookDocumentFilter = {
	/** The type of the enclosing notebook. */
	notebookType: string;

	/** A Uri scheme, like `file` or `untitled`. */
	scheme?: string;

	/** A glob pattern. */
	pattern?: string;
} | {
	/** The type of the enclosing notebook. */
	notebookType?: string;

	/** A Uri scheme, like `file` or `untitled`.*/
	scheme: string;

	/** A glob pattern. */
	pattern?: string;
} | {
	/** The type of the enclosing notebook. */
	notebookType?: string;

	/** A Uri scheme, like `file` or `untitled`. */
	scheme?: string;

	/** A glob pattern. */
	pattern: string;
};

#+end_src

Given these structures a Python cell document in a Jupyter notebook stored on disk in a folder having =books1=  in its path can be identified as follows;

#+begin_src c
{
	notebook: {
		scheme: 'file',
		pattern '**/books1/**',
		notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook'
	},
	language: 'python'
}

#+end_src

A =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notebookCellTextDocumentFilter][NotebookCellTextDocumentFilter]]= can be used to register providers for certain requests like code complete or hover. If such a provider is registered the client will send the corresponding =textDocument/*=  requests to the server using the cell text document’s URI as the document URI.

There are cases where simply only knowing about a cell’s text content is not enough for a server to reason about the cells content and to provide good language smarts. Sometimes it is necessary to know all cells of a notebook document including the notebook document itself. Consider a notebook that has two JavaScript cells with the following content

Cell one:

#+begin_src c
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

#+end_src

Cell two:

#+begin_src c
add/*<cursor>*/;

#+end_src

Requesting code assist in cell two at the marked cursor position should propose the function =add=  which is only possible if the server knows about cell one and cell two and knows that they belong to the same notebook document.

The protocol will therefore support two modes when it comes to synchronizing cell text content:

- /cellContent/: in this mode only the cell text content is synchronized to the server using the standard =textDocument/did*=  notification. No notebook document and no cell structure is synchronized. This mode allows for easy adoption of notebooks since servers can reuse most of it implementation logic.
- /notebook/: in this mode the notebook document, the notebook cells and the notebook cell text content is synchronized to the server. To allow servers to create a consistent picture of a notebook document the cell text content is NOT synchronized using the standard =textDocument/did*= notifications. It is instead synchronized using special =notebookDocument/did*=  notifications. This ensures that the cell and its text content arrives on the server using one open, change or close event.

To request the cell content only a normal document selector can be used. For example the selector =[{ language: 'python' }]= will synchronize Python notebook document cells to the server. However since this might synchronize unwanted documents as well a document filter can also be a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notebookCellTextDocumentFilter][NotebookCellTextDocumentFilter]]=. So ={ notebook: { scheme: 'file', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook' }, language: 'python' }=  synchronizes all Python cells in a Jupyter notebook stored on disk.

To synchronize the whole notebook document a server provides a =notebookDocumentSync=  in its server capabilities. For example:

#+begin_src c
{
	notebookDocumentSync: {
		notebookSelector: [
			{
				notebook: { scheme: 'file', notebookType: 'jupyter-notebook' },
				cells: [{ language: 'python' }]
			}
		]
	}
}

#+end_src

Synchronizes the notebook including all Python cells to the server if the notebook is stored on disk.

- property name (optional): =notebookDocument.synchronization= 
- property type: =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#notebookDocumentSyncClientCapabilities][NotebookDocumentSyncClientCapabilities]]=  defined as follows

#+begin_quote


/Since version 3.16.0/


#+end_quote

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve semantic tokens for a given file. Semantic tokens are used to add additional color information to a file that depends on language specific symbol information. A semantic token request usually produces a large result. The protocol therefore supports encoding tokens with numbers. In addition optional support for deltas is available.

/General Concepts/

Tokens are represented using one token type combined with n token modifiers. A token type is something like =class= or =function= and token modifiers are like =static= or =async= . The protocol defines a set of token types and modifiers but clients are allowed to extend these and announce the values they support in the corresponding client capability. The predefined values are:

#+begin_src c
export enum SemanticTokenTypes {
	namespace = 'namespace',
	/**
	 * Represents a generic type. Acts as a fallback for types which
	 * can't be mapped to a specific type like class or enum.
	 */
	type = 'type',
	class = 'class',
	enum = 'enum',
	interface = 'interface',
	struct = 'struct',
	typeParameter = 'typeParameter',
	parameter = 'parameter',
	variable = 'variable',
	property = 'property',
	enumMember = 'enumMember',
	event = 'event',
	function = 'function',
	method = 'method',
	macro = 'macro',
	keyword = 'keyword',
	modifier = 'modifier',
	comment = 'comment',
	string = 'string',
	number = 'number',
	regexp = 'regexp',
	operator = 'operator',
	/**
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	decorator = 'decorator'
}

#+end_src

#+begin_src c
export enum SemanticTokenModifiers {
	declaration = 'declaration',
	definition = 'definition',
	readonly = 'readonly',
	static = 'static',
	deprecated = 'deprecated',
	abstract = 'abstract',
	async = 'async',
	modification = 'modification',
	documentation = 'documentation',
	defaultLibrary = 'defaultLibrary'
}

#+end_src

The protocol defines an additional token format capability to allow future extensions of the format. The only format that is currently specified is =relative=  expressing that the tokens are described using relative positions (see Integer Encoding for Tokens below).

#+begin_src c
export namespace TokenFormat {
	export const Relative: 'relative' = 'relative';
}

export type TokenFormat = 'relative';

#+end_src

/Integer Encoding for Tokens/

On the capability level types and modifiers are defined using strings. However the real encoding happens using numbers. The server therefore needs to let the client know which numbers it is using for which types and modifiers. They do so using a legend, which is defined as follows:

#+begin_src c
export interface SemanticTokensLegend {
	/**
	 * The token types a server uses.
	 */
	tokenTypes: string[];

	/**
	 * The token modifiers a server uses.
	 */
	tokenModifiers: string[];
}

#+end_src

Token types are looked up by index, so a =tokenType= value of =1= means =tokenTypes[1]=. Since a token type can have n modifiers, multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags, so a =tokenModifier= value of =3= is first viewed as binary =0b00000011=, which means =[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]=  because bits 0 and 1 are set.

There are different ways how the position of a token can be expressed in a file. Absolute positions or relative positions. The protocol for the token format =relative= uses relative positions, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file. This simplifies the computation of a delta if a server supports it. So each token is represented using 5 integers. A specific token =i=  in the file consists of the following array indices:

- at index =5*i= - =deltaLine= : token line number, relative to the start of the previous token
- at index =5*i+1= - =deltaStart= : token start character, relative to the start of the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token’s start if they are on the same line)
- at index =5*i+2= - =length= : the length of the token.
- at index =5*i+3= - =tokenType=: will be looked up in =SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes=. We currently ask that =tokenType=  < 65536.
- at index =5*i+4= - =tokenModifiers=: each set bit will be looked up in =SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers= 

The =deltaStart= and the =length= values must be encoded using the encoding the client and server agrees on during the =initialize= request (see also [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocuments][TextDocuments]]). Whether a token can span multiple lines is defined by the client capability =multilineTokenSupport= . If multiline tokens are not supported and a tokens length takes it past the end of the line, it should be treated as if the token ends at the end of the line and will not wrap onto the next line.

The client capability =overlappingTokenSupport=  defines whether tokens can overlap each other.

Lets look at a concrete example which uses single line tokens without overlaps for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a number array. We start with absolute positions to demonstrate how they can easily be transformed into relative positions:

#+begin_src c
{ line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",
	tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"]
},
{ line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type", tokenModifiers: [] },
{ line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class", tokenModifiers: [] }

#+end_src

First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front on registration and capture all possible token types and modifiers. For the example we use this legend:

#+begin_src c
{
   tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
   tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
}

#+end_src

The first transformation step is to encode =tokenType= and =tokenModifiers= as integers using the legend. As said, token types are looked up by index, so a =tokenType= value of =1= means =tokenTypes[1]=. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags, so a =tokenModifier= value of =3= is first viewed as binary =0b00000011=, which means =[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]=  because bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:

#+begin_src c
{ line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
{ line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
{ line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }

#+end_src

The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token is on the same line as the first token, so the =startChar= of the second token is made relative to the =startChar= of the first token, so it will be =10 - 5=. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the =startChar=  of the third token will not be altered:

#+begin_src c
{ deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
{ deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
{ deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }

#+end_src

Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:

#+begin_src c
// 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
[  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]

#+end_src

Now assume that the user types a new empty line at the beginning of the file which results in the following tokens in the file:

#+begin_src c
{ line: 3, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",
	tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"]
},
{ line: 3, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type", tokenModifiers: [] },
{ line: 6, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class", tokenModifiers: [] }

#+end_src

Running the same transformations as above will result in the following number array:

#+begin_src c
// 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
[  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0]

#+end_src

The delta is now expressed on these number arrays without any form of interpretation what these numbers mean. This is comparable to the text document edits send from the server to the client to modify the content of a file. Those are character based and don’t make any assumption about the meaning of the characters. So =[ 2,5,3,0,3, 0,5,4,1,0, 3,2,7,2,0 ]= can be transformed into =[ 3,5,3,0,3, 0,5,4,1,0, 3,2,7,2,0]= using the following edit description: ={ start: 0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] }= which tells the client to simply replace the first number (e.g. =2=) in the array with =3= .

Semantic token edits behave conceptually like [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textEditArray][text edits]] on documents: if an edit description consists of n edits all n edits are based on the same state Sm of the number array. They will move the number array from state Sm to Sm+1. A client applying the edits must not assume that they are sorted. An easy algorithm to apply them to the number array is to sort the edits and apply them from the back to the front of the number array.

*Requesting semantic tokens for a range*

There are two uses cases where it can be beneficial to only compute semantic tokens for a visible range:

- for faster rendering of the tokens in the user interface when a user opens a file. In this use cases servers should also implement the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#semanticTokens_fullRequest][textDocument/semanticTokens/full]]=  request as well to allow for flicker free scrolling and semantic coloring of a minimap.
- if computing semantic tokens for a full document is too expensive servers can only provide a range call. In this case the client might not render a minimap correctly or might even decide to not show any semantic tokens at all.

A server is allowed to compute the semantic tokens for a broader range than requested by the client. However if the server does the semantic tokens for the broader range must be complete and correct. If a token at the beginning or end only partially overlaps with the requested range the server should include those tokens in the response.

*Requesting a refresh of all semantic tokens*

The =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#semanticTokens_refreshRequest][workspace/semanticTokens/refresh]]=  request is sent from the server to the client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the editors for which this server provides semantic tokens. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the semantic tokens for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a project wide configuration change which requires a re-calculation of all semantic tokens. Note that the client still has the freedom to delay the re-calculation of the semantic tokens if for example an editor is currently not visible.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][Completion Request (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/21a9.png)))]]

The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense][IntelliSense]] user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request (‘completionItem/resolve’). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typical use case is for example: the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][textDocument/completion]]= request doesn’t fill in the =documentation= property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a ‘completionItem/resolve’ request is sent with the selected completion item as a parameter. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in. By default the request can only delay the computation of the =detail= and =documentation= properties. Since 3.16.0 the client can signal that it can resolve more properties lazily. This is done using the =completionItem#resolveSupport= client capability which lists all properties that can be filled in during a ‘completionItem/resolve’ request. All other properties (usually =sortText=, =filterText=, =insertText= and =textEdit=) must be provided in the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion][textDocument/completion]]=  response and must not be changed during resolve.

The language server protocol uses the following model around completions:

- to achieve consistency across languages and to honor different clients usually the client is responsible for filtering and sorting. This has also the advantage that client can experiment with different filter and sorting models. However servers can enforce different behavior by setting a =filterText= / =sortText= 
- for speed clients should be able to filter an already received completion list if the user continues typing. Servers can opt out of this using a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionList][CompletionList]]= and mark it as =isIncomplete= .

A completion item provides additional means to influence filtering and sorting. They are expressed by either creating a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionItem][CompletionItem]]= with a =insertText= or with a =textEdit= . The two modes differ as follows:

- *Completion item provides an insertText / label without a text edit* : in the model the client should filter against what the user has already typed using the word boundary rules of the language (e.g. resolving the word under the cursor position). The reason for this mode is that it makes it extremely easy for a server to implement a basic completion list and get it filtered on the client.
  
- *Completion Item with text edits*: in this mode the server tells the client that it actually knows what it is doing. If you create a completion item with a text edit at the current cursor position no word guessing takes place and no automatic filtering (like with an =insertText= ) should happen. This mode can be combined with a sort text and filter text to customize two things. If the text edit is a replace edit then the range denotes the word used for filtering. If the replace changes the text it most likely makes sense to specify a filter text to be used.

Completion items support snippets (see =InsertTextFormat.Snippet= ). The snippet format is as follows:

***** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#snippet_syntax][Snippet Syntax]]

The =body=  of a snippet can use special constructs to control cursors and the text being inserted. The following are supported features and their syntaxes:

***** Tab stops

With tab stops, you can make the editor cursor move inside a snippet. Use =$1=, =$2= to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tab stops will be visited, whereas =$0=  denotes the final cursor position. Multiple tab stops are linked and updated in sync.

***** Placeholders

Placeholders are tab stops with values, like =${1:foo}=. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like =${1:another ${2:placeholder}}= .

***** Choice

Placeholders can have choices as values. The syntax is a comma separated enumeration of values, enclosed with the pipe-character, for example =${1|one,two,three|}= . When the snippet is inserted and the placeholder selected, choices will prompt the user to pick one of the values.

***** Variables

With =$name= or =${name:default}= you can insert the value of a variable. When a variable isn’t set, its /default/  or the empty string is inserted. When a variable is unknown (that is, its name isn’t defined) the name of the variable is inserted and it is transformed into a placeholder.

The following variables can be used:

- =TM_SELECTED_TEXT=  The currently selected text or the empty string
- =TM_CURRENT_LINE=  The contents of the current line
- =TM_CURRENT_WORD=  The contents of the word under cursor or the empty string
- =TM_LINE_INDEX=  The zero-index based line number
- =TM_LINE_NUMBER=  The one-index based line number
- =TM_FILENAME=  The filename of the current document
- =TM_FILENAME_BASE=  The filename of the current document without its extensions
- =TM_DIRECTORY=  The directory of the current document
- =TM_FILEPATH=  The full file path of the current document

***** Variable Transforms

Transformations allow you to modify the value of a variable before it is inserted. The definition of a transformation consists of three parts:

1. A [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#regExp][regular expression]] that is matched against the value of a variable, or the empty string when the variable cannot be resolved.
2. A “format string” that allows to reference matching groups from the regular expression. The format string allows for conditional inserts and simple modifications.
3. Options that are passed to the regular expression.

The following example inserts the name of the current file without its ending, so from =foo.txt= it makes =foo= .

#+begin_src c
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)\..+$/$1/}
  |           |         | |
  |           |         | |-> no options
  |           |         |
  |           |         |-> references the contents of the first
  |           |             capture group
  |           |
  |           |-> regex to capture everything before
  |               the final `.suffix`
  |
  |-> resolves to the filename

#+end_src

***** Grammar

Below is the EBNF ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus-Naur_form][extended Backus-Naur form]]) for snippets. With =\= (backslash), you can escape =$=, =}= and =\= . Within choice elements, the backslash also escapes comma and pipe characters.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_publishDiagnostics][PublishDiagnostics Notification (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b05.png)))]]

Diagnostics notifications are sent from the server to the client to signal results of validation runs.

Diagnostics are “owned” by the server so it is the server’s responsibility to clear them if necessary. The following rule is used for VS Code servers that generate diagnostics:

- if a language is single file only (for example HTML) then diagnostics are cleared by the server when the file is closed. Please note that open / close events don’t necessarily reflect what the user sees in the user interface. These events are ownership events. So with the current version of the specification it is possible that problems are not cleared although the file is not visible in the user interface since the client has not closed the file yet.
- if a language has a project system (for example C#) diagnostics are not cleared when a file closes. When a project is opened all diagnostics for all files are recomputed (or read from a cache).

When a file changes it is the server’s responsibility to re-compute diagnostics and push them to the client. If the computed set is empty it has to push the empty array to clear former diagnostics. Newly pushed diagnostics always replace previously pushed diagnostics. There is no merging that happens on the client side.

See also the [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#diagnostic][Diagnostic]] section.

Diagnostics are currently published by the server to the client using a notification. This model has the advantage that for workspace wide diagnostics the server has the freedom to compute them at a server preferred point in time. On the other hand the approach has the disadvantage that the server can’t prioritize the computation for the file in which the user types or which are visible in the editor. Inferring the client’s UI state from the =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didOpen][textDocument/didOpen]]= and =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didChange][textDocument/didChange]]=  notifications might lead to false positives since these notifications are ownership transfer notifications.

The specification therefore introduces the concept of diagnostic pull requests to give a client more control over the documents for which diagnostics should be computed and at which point in time.

The workspace diagnostic request is sent from the client to the server to ask the server to compute workspace wide diagnostics which previously where pushed from the server to the client. In contrast to the document diagnostic request the workspace request can be long running and is not bound to a specific workspace or document state. If the client supports streaming for the workspace diagnostic pull it is legal to provide a document diagnostic report multiple times for the same document URI. The last one reported will win over previous reports.

If a client receives a diagnostic report for a document in a workspace diagnostic request for which the client also issues individual document diagnostic pull requests the client needs to decide which diagnostics win and should be presented. In general:

- diagnostics for a higher document version should win over those from a lower document version (e.g. note that document versions are steadily increasing)
- diagnostics from a document pull should win over diagnostics from a workspace pull.

***** Implementation Considerations

Generally the language server specification doesn’t enforce any specific client implementation since those usually depend on how the client UI behaves. However since diagnostics can be provided on a document and workspace level here are some tips:

- a client should pull actively for the document the users types in.
- if the server signals inter file dependencies a client should also pull for visible documents to ensure accurate diagnostics. However the pull should happen less frequently.
- if the server signals workspace pull support a client should also pull for workspace diagnostics. It is recommended for clients to implement partial result progress for the workspace pull to allow servers to keep the request open for a long time. If a server closes a workspace diagnostic pull request the client should re-trigger the request.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction][Code Action Request (((https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/21a9.png)))]]

The code action request is sent from the client to the server to compute commands for a given text document and range. These commands are typically code fixes to either fix problems or to beautify/refactor code. The result of a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction][textDocument/codeAction]]= request is an array of =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#command][Command]]= literals which are typically presented in the user interface. To ensure that a server is useful in many clients the commands specified in a code actions should be handled by the server and not by the client (see =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_executeCommand][workspace/executeCommand]]= and =ServerCapabilities.executeCommandProvider= ). If the client supports providing edits with a code action then that mode should be used.

/Since version 3.16.0:/  a client can offer a server to delay the computation of code action properties during a ‘textDocument/codeAction’ request:

This is useful for cases where it is expensive to compute the value of a property (for example the =edit= property). Clients signal this through the =codeAction.resolveSupport= capability which lists all properties a client can resolve lazily. The server capability =codeActionProvider.resolveProvider= signals that a server will offer a =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#codeAction_resolve][codeAction/resolve]]= route. To help servers to uniquely identify a code action in the resolve request, a code action literal can optional carry a data property. This is also guarded by an additional client capability =codeAction.dataSupport= . In general, a client should offer data support if it offers resolve support. It should also be noted that servers shouldn’t alter existing attributes of a code action in a codeAction/resolve request.

#+begin_quote


/Since version 3.8.0:/  support for CodeAction literals to enable the following scenarios:


#+end_quote

- the ability to directly return a workspace edit from the code action request. This avoids having another server roundtrip to execute an actual code action.

The =workspace/configuration= request is sent from the server to the client to fetch configuration settings from the client. The request can fetch several configuration settings in one roundtrip. The order of the returned configuration settings correspond to the order of the passed =ConfigurationItems=  (e.g. the first item in the response is the result for the first configuration item in the params).

A =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#configurationItem][ConfigurationItem]]= consists of the configuration section to ask for and an additional scope URI. The configuration section asked for is defined by the server and doesn’t necessarily need to correspond to the configuration store used by the client. So a server might ask for a configuration =cpp.formatterOptions= but the client stores the configuration in an XML store layout differently. It is up to the client to do the necessary conversion. If a scope URI is provided the client should return the setting scoped to the provided resource. If the client for example uses [[http://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] to manage its settings the configuration should be returned for the passed resource URI. If the client can’t provide a configuration setting for a given scope then =null=  needs to be present in the returned array.

This pull model replaces the old push model were the client signaled configuration change via an event. If the server still needs to react to configuration changes (since the server caches the result of =workspace/configuration=  requests) the server should register for an empty configuration change using the following registration pattern:

The watched files notification is sent from the client to the server when the client detects changes to files and folders watched by the language client (note although the name suggest that only file events are sent it is about file system events which include folders as well). It is recommended that servers register for these file system events using the registration mechanism. In former implementations clients pushed file events without the server actively asking for it.

Servers are allowed to run their own file system watching mechanism and not rely on clients to provide file system events. However this is not recommended due to the following reasons:

- to our experience getting file system watching on disk right is challenging, especially if it needs to be supported across multiple OSes.
- file system watching is not for free especially if the implementation uses some sort of polling and keeps a file system tree in memory to compare time stamps (as for example some node modules do)
- a client usually starts more than one server. If every server runs its own file system watching it can become a CPU or memory problem.
- in general there are more server than client implementations. So this problem is better solved on the client side.

The telemetry notification is sent from the server to the client to ask the client to log a telemetry event. The protocol doesn’t specify the payload since no interpretation of the data happens in the protocol.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#implementationConsiderations][Implementation Considerations]]

Language servers usually run in a separate process and clients communicate with them in an asynchronous fashion. Additionally clients usually allow users to interact with the source code even if request results are pending. We recommend the following implementation pattern to avoid that clients apply outdated response results:

- if a client sends a request to the server and the client state changes in a way that it invalidates the response it should do the following:
  - cancel the server request and ignore the result if the result is not useful for the client anymore. If necessary the client should resend the request.
  - keep the request running if the client can still make use of the result by, for example, transforming it to a new result by applying the state change to the result.
- servers should therefore not decide by themselves to cancel requests simply due to that fact that a state change notification is detected in the queue. As said the result could still be useful for the client.
- if a server detects an internal state change (for example, a project context changed) that invalidates the result of a request in execution the server can error these requests with =ContentModified=. If clients receive a =ContentModified=  error, it generally should not show it in the UI for the end-user. Clients can resend the request if they know how to do so. It should be noted that for all position based requests it might be especially hard for clients to re-craft a request.
- a client should not send resolve requests for out of date objects (for example, code lenses, …). If a server receives a resolve request for an out of date object the server can error these requests with =ContentModified= .
- if a client notices that a server exits unexpectedly, it should try to restart the server. However clients should be careful not to restart a crashing server endlessly. VS Code, for example, doesn’t restart a server which has crashed 5 times in the last 180 seconds.

Servers usually support different communication channels (e.g. stdio, pipes, …). To ease the usage of servers in different clients it is highly recommended that a server implementation supports the following command line arguments to pick the communication channel:

- *stdio* : uses stdio as the communication channel.
- *pipe*: use pipes (Windows) or socket files (Linux, Mac) as the communication channel. The pipe / socket file name is passed as the next arg or with ~--pipe=~ .
- *socket*: uses a socket as the communication channel. The port is passed as next arg or with ~--port=~ .
- *node-ipc* : use node IPC communication between the client and the server. This is only supported if both client and server run under node.

To support the case that the editor starting a server crashes an editor should also pass its process id to the server. This allows the server to monitor the editor process and to shutdown itself if the editor process dies. The process id passed on the command line should be the same as the one passed in the initialize parameters. The command line argument to use is =--clientProcessId= .

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#metaModel][Meta Model]]

Since 3.17 there is a meta model describing the LSP protocol:

- [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/metaModel/metaModel.json][metaModel.json]]: The actual meta model for the LSP 3.17 specification
- [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/metaModel/metaModel.ts][metaModel.ts]]: A TypeScript file defining the data types that make up the meta model.
- [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/metaModel/metaModel.schema.json][metaModel.schema.json]]: A JSON schema file defining the data types that make up the meta model. Can be used to generate code to read the meta model JSON file.

**** [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#version_3_0_0][3.0 Version]]

- add support for client feature flags to support that servers can adapt to different client capabilities. An example is the new =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_willSaveWaitUntil][textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil]]=  request which not all clients might be able to support. If the feature is disabled in the client capabilities sent on the initialize request, the server can’t rely on receiving the request.
- add support to experiment with new features. The new =ClientCapabilities.experimental=  section together with feature flags allow servers to provide experimental feature without the need of ALL clients to adopt them immediately.
- servers can more dynamically react to client features. Capabilities can now be registered and unregistered after the initialize request using the new =client/registerCapability= and =client/unregisterCapability= . This for example allows servers to react to settings or configuration changes without a restart.
- add support for =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_willSave][textDocument/willSave]]= notification and =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_willSaveWaitUntil][textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil]]=  request.
- add support for =[[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_documentLink][textDocument/documentLink]]=  request.
- add a =rootUri= property to the initializeParams in favor of the =rootPath=  property.
